# Node Authentication Trust System - Deployment Package

## Overview
ML-based trust and reputation system for node authentication using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 96.91%
- **Precision**: 98.42%
- **Recall**: 94.34%
- **F1-Score**: 96.34%
- **ROC-AUC**: 99.49%

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from prediction_api import NodeAuthenticator

# Initialize
auth = NodeAuthenticator(model_dir='../models')

# Predict
result = auth.predict(node_features)

print(f"Action: {result['action']}")  # BLOCK, MONITOR, or ALLOW
print(f"Trust Score: {result['trust_score']}/100")
```

## Trust Score Interpretation

- **0-33 (Low Trust)**: BLOCK - High risk, deny access
- **33-66 (Medium Trust)**: MONITOR - Moderate risk, additional verification needed
- **66-100 (High Trust)**: ALLOW - Low risk, grant access

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set up monitoring for prediction latency
- [ ] Implement logging for all predictions
- [ ] Set up alerts for high false positive rates
- [ ] Schedule periodic model retraining with new data
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for model updates
- [ ] Set up load balancing for high-throughput scenarios
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated predictions
- [ ] Add API authentication and rate limiting
