**Total:** 245 samples across 20 files

## 🎯 Data Characteristics

### Attack Types Included:
1. **DoS (Denial of Service)** - Files 6-7, 10
   - High connection counts (50-500)
   - High error rates (>80%)
   - Zero duration
   - Max destination host count (255)

2. **Probe/Scan Attacks** - Files 11-12
   - Port scanning behavior
   - High diff_srv_rate (0.7-1.0)
   - Low same_srv_rate (0-0.3)
   - Multiple service probing

3. **R2L (Remote to Local)** - Files 13-14
   - Failed login attempts
   - Unauthorized access patterns
   - Guest login flags
   - Targeting auth services (ftp, telnet, ssh)

4. **U2R (User to Root)** - File 15
   - Privilege escalation
   - Root shell indicators
   - File/shell creation activities
   - High compromised indicators

5. **Normal Traffic** - Files 1-5, parts of mixed files
   - Logged in successfully
   - Low error rates
   - Standard protocols (tcp/udp)
   - Common services (http, ftp, smtp)

### Feature Distribution:
- **41 features** per row (all required features)
- **3 categorical:** protocol_type, service, flag
- **38 numeric:** connection, content, traffic, host-based features
- **Realistic value ranges** based on NSL-KDD dataset

## 🧪 Quick Test Guide

### Test 1: Normal Traffic Detection
```
Upload: test1.csv or test2.csv
Expected: High trust scores (66-100), ALLOW actions
Purpose: Verify normal traffic identification
```

### Test 2: DoS Attack Detection
```
Upload: test6.csv or test7.csv
Expected: Low trust scores (0-33), BLOCK actions
Purpose: Verify DoS attack detection
```

### Test 3: Mixed Traffic Analysis
```
Upload: test8.csv (50/50 mix)
Expected: Varied trust scores, mixed actions
Purpose: Verify classification in mixed scenarios
```

### Test 4: Specific Attack Types
```
Upload: test11.csv (Probe), test13.csv (R2L), test15.csv (U2R)
Expected: Low-medium trust, BLOCK/MONITOR actions
Purpose: Verify different attack type detection
```

### Test 5: Varying Ratios
```
Upload: test4.csv (90% normal), test10.csv (10% normal), test16.csv (70% normal)
Expected: Trust scores correlate with normal traffic ratio
Purpose: Verify model performance across different distributions
```

## 💡 Testing Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Start with extremes:** Test pure normal (test1) and pure attacks (test6) first
2. **Test mixed scenarios:** Use test8, test16-18 to see classification boundaries
3. **Compare attack types:** Test11-15 show model's ability to detect different attacks
4. **Check ratios:** Test4, 5, 19 vs test9, 10, 20 show ratio impact
5. **Download results:** Save predictions for each file to compare offline

### What to Look For:
- ✓ High trust scores for normal traffic
- ✓ Low trust scores for attacks
- ✓ Appropriate actions (ALLOW/MONITOR/BLOCK)
- ✓ Confidence levels matching predictions
- ✓ Consistent behavior across similar files
